# HUME — Lessons Learned

Patterns that bit us; rules to prevent recurrence.

## L1 — Side-effect cluster regression (2026-06)

**Root cause:** A refactor added a *second* code path for an operation whose
correctness depends on a *cluster* of side effects, not just the primary effect.
The old path kept its inline bookkeeping; the new path was a bare copy of the
execution match without any of the surrounding bookkeeping.  Tests pinned the
primary effect (cursor moved, text changed) and stayed green on both paths.  The
entire cluster (jump list, `last_command`, dot-repeat, paste-session commit,
register routing) regressed silently on the new path.

**Concrete instance:** `b7a5af0` added `run_command_sync` for Steel `(call!)`.
Cursor/text assertions passed.  Nine bookkeeping regressions shipped.

**Prevention rules:**

1. **Path parity test** — whenever a refactor adds or forks a dispatch path,
   add a parity test asserting that both paths leave identical state (use a
   `BookkeepingSnapshot`-style helper that captures the whole cluster).  Never
   assert only the primary effect.

2. **Single-funnel lint** — all execution of native-command `fun` fields must
   go through `run_native_body` in `commands/mod.rs` (wrapped by
   `run_dispatch_pipeline` for bookkeeping).  The lint
   `single_native_dispatch_funnel` in `lints.rs` enforces this: any second
   `match cmd` that binds a native variant's `fun` outside that file fails the
   build.

3. **Duplicate-match smell** — two identical `match cmd { Motion { fun } | … }`
   arms in different files is a SSOT violation.  Collapse to one funnel.

**Files:** `hume-editor/src/editor/commands/mod.rs` (funnel),
`hume-editor/src/editor/lints.rs` (lint), `hume-editor/src/editor/tests/mod.rs`
(snapshot helper), `hume-editor/src/editor/tests/sync_dispatch.rs` (parity tests).

## L2 — "call A, then remember to call B" footgun (2026-07)

**Root cause:** Two operations were coupled by convention instead of by code:
every call site that called `ScopeRegistry::intern`/`intern_runtime` (A) had to
remember a matching `Theme::bake` (B) before the next render, or a newly
interned `ScopeId` would resolve to the *default* style — silently, since the
out-of-range guard was only a `debug_assert!` (no-op in release). Every call
site paired them correctly by hand, which meant the invariant held only as
long as nobody wrote a new call site — a bug waiting for the next commit that
interned a scope without knowing it needed a bake.

**Concrete instance:** flagged in code review as a "latent footgun" — not yet
triggered, since every existing intern site happened to already pair with a
bake. Fixed in `0b97c3f` before it could bite.

**Prevention rule — when A/B pairing can't be enforced by visibility or types,
make B self-triggering at the one place state is consumed, not at every place
it's produced.**

Concretely: don't chase every call site of A and insert a matching B (that's
the discipline this lesson is about *not* relying on). Instead:

1. Find the *single* place the paired state is actually read on the
   hot/production path (here: `prepare_frame`, the per-frame `&mut` chokepoint
   that runs before every `render`).
2. Give B a self-check that makes it a no-op when already-consistent, and call
   it unconditionally from that one place (here: `Theme::bake_if_stale`, which
   compares `baked.len()` vs `registry.len()` — cheap because `ScopeRegistry` is
   append-only, so the lengths alone detect staleness with no extra state).
3. Delete every hand-paired B at the individual A call sites. If B is only
   needed because of A, and B is now automatic, a manually-placed B is dead
   weight that can drift (e.g. call it twice, or call it and still forget it
   elsewhere) — one chokepoint, not N call sites each promising to behave.

This beats the compile-time-enforced alternative (make A `pub(crate)`, force
every caller through a wrapper that also calls B) when A has legitimate
callers outside the module that can't be rerouted without signature churn
(here: `hume-editor`'s runtime grammar/plugin code interns scope names that
`hume-engine` can't own). Self-healing at the read side gets the same
correctness guarantee — B can never be forgotten because nothing depends on it
being called promptly — without touching A's callers at all.

**Files:** `hume-engine/src/theme/mod.rs` (`Theme::bake_if_stale`),
`hume-editor/src/editor/lifecycle.rs` (`prepare_frame` call site).
