//! The one Insert, Paste, or dot-repeat-replay session live in the editor,

//!
//! [`EditorState::active_session`] relies on the invariant that at most one
//! pane is ever mid-Insert, has a paste session open, or holds a dot-repeat
//! replay's own placeholder. Every session records its own owner `(pane,
//! buffer)`, so `focus::end_focus_sessions` — run by
//! every focus change and buffer switch — commits or tears it down by
//! reading that owner directly rather than current focus; ordering relative
//! to the focus write doesn't matter. Recording the owner as one value also
//! makes "is there a conflicting session elsewhere" a single field
//! comparison rather than a scan over every pane, and makes a stale session
//! left open by a caller that forgot to tear it down impossible to
//! represent silently — there is exactly one `Option` to get right, not one
//! per (pane, buffer) pair. Mirrors the pattern completion sessions already
//! use (`BufferSession` stores its `pane_id` directly on the session, not
//! keyed by a per-pane map).
